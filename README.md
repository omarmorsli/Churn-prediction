# Churn-prediction

Personal project: to get familiar with customer attrition, data viz using Plotly.

## Background
Phoning companies are always facing churn problems. One of these companies has collected a dataset on their past customers and asks to: 

1/ rank their customers according to the probability of churn 

2/ tell who are the clients they should contact and what should be the relevant personalized discount to propose in order to maximize the future profit of the company (tradeoff between churn prevention and reduced profit per customer after discount).
